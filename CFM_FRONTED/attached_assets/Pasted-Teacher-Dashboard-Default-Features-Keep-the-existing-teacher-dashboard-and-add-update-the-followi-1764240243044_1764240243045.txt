Teacher → HOD transition must feel natural, meaning:
No UI clutter, HOD tools should be grouped cleanly under a “Department Management” section.

Admin Role (No Change Needed But Keep Structure)

Admin can access everything.
Ensure code structure supports 3 roles:

Admin

HOD

Teacher

Use JavaScript to show/hide menu items based on userRole variable:

const userRole = "HOD"; // or "Teacher" / "Admin"


Create reusable functions:

loadTeacherDashboard();

loadHodDashboardExtras();

loadAdminDashboardExtras();

Styling Requirement

Use Bootstrap 5

Smooth transitions

Sidebar role-based expand sections

HOD specific section must have special badge like:

“HOD Tools”

Keep dashboard visually very clean and professional
