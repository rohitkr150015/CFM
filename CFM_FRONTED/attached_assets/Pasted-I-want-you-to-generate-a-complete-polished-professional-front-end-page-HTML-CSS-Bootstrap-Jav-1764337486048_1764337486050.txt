I want you to generate a complete, polished, professional front-end page (HTML + CSS/Bootstrap + JavaScript) for a Teacher Notes Upload System similar to Google Classroom.

Below is the exact functionality required.
Follow everything carefully.
Make the UI modern, clean, responsive, and professional.

🔥 PROJECT REQUIREMENTS
1. Teacher Dashboard

The teacher dashboard must show:

Teacher Name

Course Name

Assigned Subjects only (Example: DBMS, OSS)

When a teacher selects a subject, only that subject’s structure appears.

🔥 Notes Upload Structure Logic (VERY IMPORTANT)

The teacher should upload notes in a hierarchical structure, exactly like this:

Course  
 └── Unit 1  
        ├── Heading (e.g., “Introduction to DBMS”)  
        │        ├── Sub Heading  
        │        │         ├── Sub Sub Heading  
        │        │         │         └── Notes Upload File  
        │        │         └── Notes Upload File  
        │        └── Notes Upload File  
        └── Another Heading  
                └── ... infinite levels  

Teacher Can Do:

✔ Add Units
✔ Add Headings
✔ Add Sub-Headings (infinite levels)
✔ Add Notes file under any heading
✔ Upload multiple files under same heading
✔ Edit File Name
✔ Delete File
✔ Download File
✔ Mark completion automatically

🔥 Upload Feature Details

Each last-level node must have:

Upload Button (PDF, DOCX, PPT, Image, etc.)

View File Name

Delete button

Edit button

Download button

Whenever a file is uploaded → mark that node as Completed (✔).

🔥 Template Feature

Admin provides multiple templates to teachers.
Teacher must see:

“Choose Template” popup

List of templates

When teacher clicks a template → UI changes to that template style

Save Template

Very similar to Google Classroom Material Templates.

🔥 Progress Tracking

Each Unit → Automatic Progress bar
Example:

Unit 1 – 4/10 Completed
[██████████------] 40%

🔥 Sidebar

Show full structure in collapsible form:

Unit 1

Unit 2

Unit 3

etc.

Inside them headings, subheadings

Sidebar must update in real-time when teacher adds anything.

✔ HTML
✔ CSS or Bootstrap 5
