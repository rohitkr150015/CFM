I want you to update and generate a complete front-end UI (HTML + CSS + Bootstrap + JS) for my Course File Management System according to the below database schema and new feature requirements. The UI must be dynamic, responsive, clean, production-level and should align 100% with the database tables so backend API can be integrated easily.

🔥 PRIMARY NEW FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT
1️⃣ HOD / ADMIN CAN CREATE TEMPLATE STRUCTURE

HOD or Admin can create a Course File Template containing 24 (or more) points/sections

These sections become Course File Headings

Heading → Sub-Heading → Sub-Sub-Heading → infinite nesting

Each heading can contain files (PDF, DOCX, PPT, images etc.)

Templates are stored in Template.structure (JSON)

2️⃣ TEACHER CAN ALSO ADD NEW HEADINGS

Even after template is applied, Teacher must be able to add more headings

Useful if Teacher has extra notes or extra topics not in template

Teacher can also add sub-heading and child nodes

Unlimited dynamic depth, like Google Classroom material structure

3️⃣ PDF / DOCUMENT COMMENT SYSTEM

Every uploaded file must have:

Feature	Required
View PDF/File	YES
Comment Box under each PDF	YES
Teacher/HOD/Admin can comment	YES
Threaded / Reply comments	YES
Store in Comment Table	YES
Show read/unread	YES

Map comments to DB:

Field	Table
comment on a course file	course_file_id
comment under unit/heading	heading_id
comment on exact file	document_id
comment by whom	author_id → Teacher.id
4️⃣ ROLE–WISE DASHBOARD BEHAVIOR
ROLE	FEATURES VISIBLE
TEACHER	Upload notes, add headings, comment, view progress
HOD	All teacher files, approve/reject, create template, comment audit
ADMIN	Full control, manage template, departments, teachers, course mapping

A normal teacher sees normal dashboard.
If teacher is HOD → additional features unlock.
If user is Admin → full system unlocked.

Check via User.role and Department.hod_id.

🔥 EXACT FRONT-END OUTPUT REQUIRED
MODULE	MUST INCLUDE
Template Builder (Admin/HOD)	drag & drop or add + remove 24 points, reorder, save JSON into DB
Template Apply Screen (Teacher)	choose course → select template → structure auto-creates using Heading table
Course File Upload UI	add unit → add heading → add sub-child nodes infinite → upload PDF → edit/delete/download
Comment System	threaded comments, reply, tagging, notifications, unread highlight
Approval System	HOD approves → Admin final approve (optional)
Activity Log	auto-record every action using Activity_Log table
DATABASE (THIS MUST BE USED IN FRONT-END MAPPING)
