PROMPT (START)

Create a complete, production-ready frontend for a Course File Manager web app using plain HTML, CSS, Bootstrap 5 (no frameworks like React). Deliver fully structured, componentized, accessible, responsive code that a developer can plug into a backend later.

Primary goals

Professional, modern SaaS dashboard aesthetic (clean spacing, readable typography, subtle shadows, consistent color system).

Pixel-perfect on desktop, tablet and mobile (Bootstrap breakpoints).

Accessibility: semantic HTML, ARIA attributes where needed, keyboard focus states, contrast ratios that meet WCAG AA.

Developer-friendly output: clear folder structure, modular partials (header, sidebar, modals), comments in code, and sample dummy data.

Pages & features (implement all)

Login / Signup / Forgot Password

Centered form card, left-side illustration on wide screens.

Inputs: Email, Password, "Remember me", Login button.

Signup and Forgot Password pages with validation messages.

Social login button placeholders (Google, Microsoft).

Dashboard (Landing after login)

Top navbar with app logo, search, notifications icon, user avatar dropdown (Profile / Settings / Logout).

Left collapsible sidebar (icons + labels) with active state:

Dashboard, Upload Files, Courses, Files, Reports, Settings.

KPI cards (Total Courses, Files, Pending Approvals, Storage Used).

Recent activity list and a chart area (placeholder chart image or canvas). Use lightweight chart placeholders and example JavaScript to initialize Chart.js (link CDN).

Courses — List & CRUD

Table with columns: Course Code, Course Title, Semester, Instructor, Files Count, Actions (Edit, Delete).

"Add Course" button opens Bootstrap modal with accessible form fields, client-side validation, and success/error alerts.

Inline edit and confirmation delete modal.

Upload Files

Course selector (select2-like searchable dropdown or Bootstrap custom select).

Drag & drop area with fallback file input.

Supported types text (PDF, DOCX, PPTX, ZIP, JPG, PNG).

Upload progress UI (progress bars per file) and client-side simulated upload via JavaScript.

After upload, show file list with thumbnails/icons, file size, uploader, upload date, and actions (View, Download, Delete).

Files Manager

Toggle between grid card view and list/table view.

Search bar and filters (Course, File Type, Semester, Date range).

File card shows file name, small preview icon, tags, actions.

Bulk select and bulk-download/delete actions (UI only).

Reports / Analytics

Card with monthly uploads chart, pie chart for file types, table of top courses by file count.

Export buttons (CSV / PDF placeholders).

Settings / Profile

Profile edit form (name, email, avatar upload).

Change password section with validation.

Notification toggles and storage usage display.

Theme toggle (light / dark switched using CSS classes).

Global UI Requirements

Use Bootstrap 5 utilities and components (navbar, nav, cards, tables, modals, form validation, tooltips).

Use Font Awesome or Bootstrap Icons via CDN.

Use Google Fonts (one or two families; headings + body).

Mobile-first responsiveness: breakpoints at xs/sm/md/lg/xl consistent with Bootstrap.

Smooth micro-interactions: hover states, focus outlines, subtle card hover lift, modal transition.

Provide a 404 and 500 simple error page template.

Code deliverables & structure

Single ZIP with:

index.html (Login)

dashboard.html

courses.html

upload.html

files.html

reports.html

settings.html

404.html

assets/ folder: css/ (custom.css), js/ (app.js, upload-sim.js), images/ (illustrations, icons), vendors/ (bootstrap, chartjs via CDN commented fallback).

Clean custom.css for theme, spacing, colors (do not override Bootstrap core unnecessarily; use utility classes and a small custom stylesheet).

app.js must contain:

Sample data arrays for courses and files used to render tables/lists.

Functions to simulate upload with progress bars.

Simple initialization code for charts (Chart.js via CDN).

Comments and TODOs where backend integration would happen (API endpoints example: /api/courses, /api/files).

Styling & branding

Color palette: Primary (hex), Secondary (muted), Accent for buttons — provide 3 HEX values. (Pick a professional blue/indigo palette.)

Typography: Google Font for headings (e.g., Inter/Roboto), body fallback system fonts.

Use consistent border radii (e.g., .5rem or .25rem) and spacing scale.

Accessibility & performance

All images must include alt text or role="presentation" if decorative.

Forms should use label tags and aria-describedby for help text.

Ensure keyboard focus order and visible focus styles.

Minimize external blocking resources and use CDN links commented in HTML.

Deliverable expectations

Fully working static frontend (no backend required) that the client can open in browser and click through.

Ready-to-download ZIP with code and assets.

Provide short README (in ZIP root) with instructions: how to open pages, where to connect API endpoints, and what to change for branding/colors.

End of prompt.
Make the HTML/CSS/Bootstrap output be clean, commented, and production mindful — the client should feel confident the UI is ready to be connected to a backend.
